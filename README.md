# Data Privacy Optimization

This is an implementation for my undergraduate thesis - _"Value-oriented Privacy Optimization in Model Based Data Marketplace"_.

Including two parts:

* DPRL (**D**ata **P**rivacy optimization using **R**einforcement **L**earning)

* FDPRL (**F**ederated **D**ata **P**rivacy optimization using **R**einforcement **L**earning)
